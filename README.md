Leveraging Enhanced Swin Transformer V2, EfficientNetV2, and Dual Attention BiLSTM for High Accuracy Cervical Cancer Diagnosis

Automated analysis of cervical cytology images remains a challenging task due to substantial variations in cell morphology, staining quality, and imaging conditions. This study introduces an enhanced hybrid deep learning framework that combines the representational strengths of Swin-Transformer-V2, EfficientNetV2-S, and a dual-attention BiLSTM module to achieve highly reliable and generalizable cervical cell classification. The proposed model employs hierarchical attention from the transformer to capture global contextual patterns, while EfficientNetV2-S efficiently encodes fine morphological textures. A dual-attention BiLSTM layer further enhances spatial–channel feature interaction, enabling more discriminative representation of complex cellular structures. The framework was systematically evaluated across five benchmark datasets—SipakMed, Herlev, ISBI 2014, Mendeley LBC, and the recently introduced RIVA (2025) dataset collectively encompassing over 22,800 annotated cell instances from both conventional Pap smear and liquid-based cytology preparations. This extensive multi-dataset evaluation demonstrates the model’s strong adaptability to heterogeneous imaging domains and varying cytological acquisition techniques. Emphasizing architectural efficiency, interpretability, and cross-domain consistency, the proposed framework establishes a foundation for robust, transparent, and scalable AI-based cytology analysis. The findings suggest its potential as a next-generation computational approach for advancing automated cervical cancer screening research and digital pathology applications.
